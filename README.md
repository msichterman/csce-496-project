This repository is home to the artifacts from the semester long project for CSCE 496: Empirical Software Engineering. This project consisted of five milestones with the end goal of conductiing an experiment/analysis on a selected topic and then writing an [IEEE conference proceedings](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) paper. We chose to do our study on data from Travis CI and GitHub via the [TravisTorrent data set](https://travistorrent.testroots.org/) in an effort to analyze the main causes of continuous integration build failures and categorize their severity. Our findings were presented and elaborated upon in our final report.

## How to Run the Data Analysis Code
1. Download this repository as a whole, or just download [CSCE496_Project.ipynb](https://github.com/msichterman/csce-496-project/blob/master/CSCE496_Project.ipynb) and [TravisTorrent-3-Projects-With-Tests.csv](https://github.com/msichterman/csce-496-project/blob/master/TravisTorrent-3-Projects-With-Tests.csv) and place them in the same directory.
2. Open the directory methioned aboce in the Jupyter Notebook software of your choice. We used [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) during our project, but tested the final file in Visual Studio Code with the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) (recommended method to run).
3. Ensure the data set is imported correctly.
4. Run the sections labeled `RQ1 Analysis` and `RQ2 Analysis` to see the results for our research questions, respectively.
